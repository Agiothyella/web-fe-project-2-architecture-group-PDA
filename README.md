### Design:
I aim to make it looks modern and feel more serious, hence clean layout with bigger whitespace and square buttons. I also use modern looking sans-serif that's have more square edges BUT more round overall shape. The idea behind the round fonts was to communicate the architecture style of east asian that have more round components (like the roof for example). The result is not what I expected. The fonts make overall feel of the page become less serious instead because it's more round, the opposite of my initial aim to make it feel serious. Despite that, the layout still gives elegant vibes, so it comes out as not bad. 

I did old webpage thing though, by adding animation to the sections once the visitor scroll down. It's fine because the composition allows it to looks good, but makes the overall feel even less serious. I was thinking maybe it's better to go all in and make the border radius bigger and make other things more round, but I think it's not proper for serious-ish architecture group to have more relaxing design. All in all, it's a good experiment with okay outcomes, and the finished page looks fine.

### Development:
I use old waypoint.js to deal with animation timing, where I probably should use modern Intersection Observer API. I didn't know, forgive me.
