# Journal:

I aim to make it looks modern, hence clean layout with bigger whitespace and modern looking sans-serif, and feel more serious by using only a little border radius on the buttons, even though the sans-serif font is more round. Despite that, I think they still gives the feel I tried to achieve, albeit not that impactful. It's fine.

I did old webpage thing though, by adding animation to the sections once the visitor scroll down. It's fine because the composition allows it to looks good, but makes the overall feeling less serious. I was thinking maybe it's better to make the border radius bigger and make things more round, but after contemplating hard, I think it's not proper for serious-ish architecture group to have more relaxing design. All in all, it's a good experiment with both good and bad outcomes that offset each other. But it's still fine.
