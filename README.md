This webpage was designed and developed by me, Agiothyella. This webpage is hosted on github as a showcase for my portofolio. Please do not copy/duplicate whole/parts of my code.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find the author/photographer for all of the images I used for this webpage. All images were hosted on public website with no credits for its author/photographer.

No copyright infringement is intended. I do not own nor claim any of the Image used in this webpage, as it only served as placeholder. If you know the author/photographer of one of the images that I don't know, email me and I'll credit them here. If you're author/photographer of one of the images I use as placeholder on this webpage and wish it to be removed, just email me and i'll remove it immediately.
